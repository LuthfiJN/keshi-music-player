      <u>less of you</u>
      
      Hello
      Are you awake right now?
      God, I just need to hear the sound of you
      Please, calm me down
      And I know that it's selfish, but
      You are the only thing that's
      Ever made sense to me, I
      I don't wanna do this
      I don't know how to do this without you
      
      Cling to your side
      Voices at night
      Cover my eyes
      I'm terrified
      No in between
      A face on a screen
      Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me
      Yeah, yeah
      
      Too much time in the limelight
      Gimme your all on the land line
      Want it so bad but I won't lie
      And it just gets worse in the night time
      
      Never stays for long
      And she's gone in the morning
      When you come home
      I just got over being less of you
      
      When you leave me
      I'm in pieces
      Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
      
      Tell me how your day was
      No, I'm not okay
      I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
      I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
      Time never moved so slow
      Bed time, hit your phone up
      Tell me where to go, where to go
      Tell me where to go, where to go
      
      Too much time in the limelight
      Gimme your all on the land line
      Want it so bad but I won't lie
      And it just gets worse in the night time
      
      Never stays for long
      And she's gone in the morning
      
      When you come home
      I just got over being less of you
      When you leave me
      I'm in pieces
      Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
      
      I don't know how to do this without you
      I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
      I don't know how to do this without you
      I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
      I don't know how to do this without you

      I can stop the bleeding
      
      Oh, babe, you know
      It happens all the time
      You give your heart to someone
      But they go and change their mind
      
      Everybody wants somebody

      Used to things falling apart
      Knew how it would end from the start
      But I can't help but chase the feeling
      
      Oh, but, babe, you know

      If it's all a waste of time
      'Cause I'm used to having no one
      To lay here by my side
      
      Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
      Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
      Ooh, you leave me torn in two, ooh
      Ooh, like they always do, ooh
